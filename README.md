# My Blocks

##### IMPORTANT: this is old Java version. For new Kotlin version see: [My Intent](https://github.com/langara/MyIntent)

An Android library: Collection of reusable views, fragments, activities, drawables and other utilities.

It is divided into seven modules:

* myactivities
* myfragments
* myviews
* mydrawables
* myres
* myloggers
* myutils

You can use any of these through JITPack:

#### Gradle Dependencies

Add following repository to your app build.gradle file:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
}
```


Then add dependencies to My Blocks modules you want:

```gradle
dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies here
    compile 'com.github.langara.MyBlocks:myactivities:v1.0.2-alpha'
    }
}
```

Change `myactivities` to module you want. The `myactivities` module depends on all other modules, so you don't have to add anything else if you add this one.
